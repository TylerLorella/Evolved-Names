"# Evolved-Names" 
Starting from a population of strings with default value "A", a target string is generated through "evolution". Currently, the target string is "TYLER LORELLA". The project was fairly simple and didn't take long but I enjoy simulations so I'm posted it. I would love take what I've learned from this assignment and the Conway's game of life to create a more in-depth simulation.
